              Additionally, with hands-on human support and stringent
              safeguards, we work diligently to maintain the platform's
              integrity and protect the interests of our community members. At
              Tskr, our aim is to provide an accessible space where freelancers
              and clients can connect and work together effectively.

                <div class="p1">
                  Tskr was born from the frustrations and challenges faced by
                  its once-freelancer founders. Having navigated the turbulent
                  waters of competing platforms, they firsthand witnessed the
                  deteriorating dynamics - the inundation of spam, escalating
                  scams, rising costs, and the often-unfair power imbalances
                  between clients and freelancers. Over time, these platforms
                  seemed to stray from their original mission, often at the
                  expense of the very freelancers they were meant to serve.
                </div>
                <div class="p2">
                  Understanding the gravity of what freelancers risk when they
                  commit to such platforms - essentially staking their
                  livelihoods and reputations - the founders felt a compelling
                  responsibility to create something different. They believed
                  that any platform acting as a bridge between freelancers and
                  clients should do so with integrity, transparency, and good
                  faith. This belief laid the cornerstone for Tskr. Built on the
                  principles of fairness and respect, Tskr is more than just a
                  marketplace - it's a promise to freelancers and clients alike
                  that they will be supported and treated justly in their
                  professional endeavors.
